###Getting and storing user input

The Scanner object allows people to input data. It captures all the input on a standard input (like the keyboard) and delivers it to a variable.

A Scanner scans the input by tokens using a delimiter pattern. The default delimiter is a space. This means that scanner assumes that each time it sees a space it is getting ready to start a new input. So if you want to capture an input that should contain spaces (like a book title, or someone's full name), you have to use a special command ```nextLine```.The scanner reads the input token by token. The resulting tokens may be converted into values of different types using various methods.

####To include the Scanner class in your program
Add the following declaration to the top of your code:
{%ace edit=false, lang='java'%}
import java.util.Scanner;
{%endace%}

Then, at some point, you will need to add this inside your program
{%ace edit=false, lang='java'%}
Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
{%endace%}

Once you have created your scanner variable, you can request data and put it into another variable like so:
{%ace edit=false, lang='java'%}
Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
String myAnswer = keyboard.next();
{%endace%}

####Methods of the Scanner class


|**Method**|**Returns**|
|-|-|
|int nextInt()|Returns the next token as an int. |
|long nextLong()|Returns the next token as a long.|
|float nextFloat()|Returns the next token as a float.|
|double nextDouble()|Returns the next token as a long.|
|String next()|Finds and returns the next complete token<br>from this scanner and returns it as a string;<br>a token is usually ended by whitespace such as a blank or line break.<br>If no token exists, NoSuchElementException is thrown.|
|String nextLine()|Returns the rest of the current line, excluding any line separator at the end.|
|void close()|Closes the scanner object.

####Your assignment....
Complete the following  program. Use the Scanner class to read the following string into variables.
Input String: "P Sherman 42 Wallaby Way Sydney"
Variables: firstInitial,lastName, houseNumber,streetName,streetType,city

Your output should be handled with this code:
```java
System.out.print(firstInitial + " " + lastName + " " + houseNumber + " ");
System.out.println(streetName + " " + streetType + " " + city);
```
