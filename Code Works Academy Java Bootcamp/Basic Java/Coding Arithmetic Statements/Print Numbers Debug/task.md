###Debug this program

This program is trying to assign two values to two variables, but if you put it in Eclipse it won't successfully run. Find and fix the error.

```java
public class DebugProg {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int x, y;

x = 3.1415;
y = 3.64;

System.out.println("pi is approximately " + x);
System.out.println("My GPA was " + y);
}
}
```
